It is perhaps best to begin by describing the population solicited. While soliciting participants via Facebook alone might have been a somewhat unorthodox decision, it did offer a number of broad statistics which would have been otherwise unavailable. One failing, however, was this: I was under the impression that Facebook recorded certain statistics in the event's metadata (e.g. total number of individuals invited to the event), when in fact, it did not. As such, some of those descriptive statistics were lost, but others were measured after the interview process had concluded. While not directly pertinent to the hypotheses discussed above or the goals of this study, I do think they do merit brief discussion.

The initial group of participants solicited was comprised of approximately forty friends and close acquaintances, roughly balanced by gender and gender and age. As was mentioned in the chapter previous, more than one-hundred participants had expressed interest in the event as the original group snowballed outward. From this point onward, an definite trend emerged: the predominance of females throughout the rest of the research process. Of the forty-nine who marked themselves as attending, only twelve identified as male. Similarly, only six males posted their narratives, while the remaining twenty-one participants were all female. While this has a direct bearing on the interviews and resulting data—in that the final sample was overwhelmingly female—it also indicates significant gendering [gendering? not sure of appropriate terminology.] of behaviours within online social spaces. Again, that question and any relevant hypotheses are outside the scope of this study and cannot be compared to any of the research already examined (other than, perhaps, Turkle's conceptualisations of "hard" and "soft" mastery of technology), but it indicates a realm of phenomena ripe for study.

But for the purposes of this study, it had the following effect: a substantial over-sampling of females over males in the final sample. Of the twelve interviews conducted, only four participants were male. While problematic at first blush, I saw it as an opportunity to broaden the research beyond my own experiences within "nerd" culture through conversation within the interviews. Indeed, the only "expert" participant—the participant who had published writing related to his technology diet—was, unsurprisingly, a male. But those lines of homogeneity, the entire sample self-identified as white. This could not be so easily understood as a blessing disguised as a curse.


When research was concluded, twelve interviews had been conducted. Of that number, eleven were "normal" computer users; all were students of The College of Wooster and had self-described themselves 
while the remaining one was one of the self-professed "nerds" who had willingly undergone a technology diet, published his experiences publicly, and agreed to an interview once I had contacted him.
