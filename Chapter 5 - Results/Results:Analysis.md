# Interview Sample

It is perhaps best to begin by describing the population solicited. While soliciting participants via Facebook alone might have been a somewhat unorthodox decision, it did offer a number of broad statistics which would have been otherwise unavailable. One failing, however, was this: I was under the impression that Facebook recorded certain statistics in the event's metadata (e.g. total number of individuals invited to the event), when in fact, it did not. As such, some of those descriptive statistics were lost, but others were measured after the interview process had concluded. While not directly pertinent to the hypotheses discussed above or the goals of this study, I do think they do merit brief discussion.

The initial group of participants solicited was comprised of approximately forty friends and close acquaintances, roughly balanced by gender and gender and age. As was mentioned in the chapter previous, more than one-hundred participants had expressed interest in the event as the original group snowballed outward. From this point onward, an definite trend emerged: the predominance of females throughout the rest of the research process. Of the forty-nine who marked themselves as attending, only twelve identified as male. Similarly, only six males posted their narratives, while the remaining twenty-one participants were all female. While this has a direct bearing on the interviews and resulting data—in that the final sample was overwhelmingly female—it also indicates significant gendering [gendering? not sure of appropriate terminology.] of behaviours within online social spaces. Again, that question and any relevant hypotheses are outside the scope of this study and cannot be compared to any of the research already examined (other than, perhaps, Turkle's conceptualisations of "hard" and "soft" mastery of technology), but it indicates a realm of phenomena ripe for study.

But for the purposes of this study, it had the following effect: a substantial over-sampling of females over males in the final sample. Of the interviews conducted, only a third of the participants were male. While problematic at first blush, I saw it as an opportunity to broaden the research beyond my own experiences within "nerd" culture through conversation within the interviews. Indeed, the only "expert" participant—the participant who had published writing related to his technology diet—was, unsurprisingly, a white male. But along those lines of homogeneity, the entire sample self-identified as white/caucasian. This could not be so easily reinterpreted as a blessing disguised as a curse. To this, I can only suggest this: such are the dangers of convenience and snowball sampling. Unconscious bias, either through the viral spread of the event's invitations, or on my part through the solicitation and contact process, resulted in such a racially homogenous sample. Analysing the causes for this are well outside the scope of this study, but it merits serious discussion—something addressed later in the Conclusion.

*Of the ten participants from the college, there was a typical degree of diversity in terms of socioeconomic background, despite the lack of racial diversity in the sample. Participants' parents' educations ranged from high school degrees to doctorates, though most had achieved Bachelor's or Master's degrees. Participants were not asked about their socioeconomic backgrounds directly; they were asked about their status regarding financial aid and work/study programs as a proxy, with participants self-describing across all of the available categories.*

When research was concluded, eleven interviews had been conducted. Of that number, eleven were "normal" computer users; students of The College of Wooster, all had self-described themselves as reasonably technologically proficient. The remaining one participant was my sole "expert" respondent—one of those who had announced their intentions to undertake a "technology diet" and had documented their experiences publicly. To reiterate: though they had published publicly about their experiences, it was made clear in our initial contact that his anonymity would be protected, so as to encourage the sharing of any details not fit for public consumption. Throughout this analysis, each of these respondents will be referred to by pseudonym. To protect their privacy and anonymity, particular details have been changed or omitted within standard and reasonable expectation; however, unlike the autoethnographic portions of this study, they have not been embellished or expanded any further.

# Analysis

Listed in the previous chapter, three hypotheses informed the how the interviews were designed and conducted. However, as I coded and analysed the data, four themes made themselves apparent. In this section, each of these themes will be analysed and discussed with respect to the theories already examined in this study. While participants had data relevant to each section, some of their responses were more poignant or relevant to specific themes at hand. *First, the broad narratives and backgrounds of the participants will be examined.* Then, each of the recurring themes will be discussed with respect to variety of experiences had by the participants. Once each of these themes has been established and discussed, only then will we evaluate each of the three hypotheses mentioned prior. 

Despite the variation in participants' backgrounds, their personal narratives around technology were astoundingly similar.  While specific circumstances varied, 

## Computer Education & Early Childhood

A large portion of *The Second Self* is dedicated to the study of children and their interactions with computers, and it is here that some of the most striking differences between Turkle's research and my own can be found. At the time of its original writing: "In most schools there was one or perhaps two computers per grade. In a few, every classroom had at least one computer. And in one special situation, every child had unlimited computer access."

## The Global Village and Contemporary Telecommunications

As was discussed prior, Marshall McLuhan was remarkably successful in hypothesising what effects a global telecommunications infrastructure might have—if not the specific forms it would take, like the Internet. While the Internet was a far-off phenomenon in the writing of *The Second Self*, and an imminent source of strife in *Alone Together*, my research confirmed the dramatic transformation that took place in the period between each of those texts. Of the ten participants from the college, none of them could recall their first experience using the Internet.
