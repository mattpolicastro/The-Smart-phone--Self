# Interview Sample

It is perhaps best to begin by describing the population solicited. While soliciting participants via Facebook alone might have been a somewhat unorthodox decision, it did offer a number of broad statistics which would have been otherwise unavailable. One failing, however, was this: I was under the impression that Facebook recorded certain statistics in the event's metadata (e.g. total number of individuals invited to the event), when in fact, it did not. As such, some of those descriptive statistics were lost, but others were measured after the interview process had concluded. While not directly pertinent to the hypotheses discussed above or the goals of this study, I do think they do merit brief discussion.

The initial group of participants solicited was comprised of approximately forty friends and close acquaintances, roughly balanced by gender and gender and age. As was mentioned in the chapter previous, more than one-hundred participants had expressed interest in the event as the original group snowballed outward. From this point onward, an definite trend emerged: the predominance of females throughout the rest of the research process. Of the forty-nine who marked themselves as attending, only twelve identified as male. Similarly, only six males posted their narratives, while the remaining twenty-one participants were all female. While this has a direct bearing on the interviews and resulting data—in that the final sample was overwhelmingly female—it also indicates significant gendering [gendering? not sure of appropriate terminology.] of behaviours within online social spaces. Again, that question and any relevant hypotheses are outside the scope of this study and cannot be compared to any of the research already examined (other than, perhaps, Turkle's conceptualisations of "hard" and "soft" mastery of technology), but it indicates a realm of phenomena ripe for study.

But for the purposes of this study, it had the following effect: a substantial over-sampling of females over males in the final sample. Of the interviews conducted, only a third of the participants were male. While problematic at first blush, I saw it as an opportunity to broaden the research beyond my own experiences within "nerd" culture through conversation within the interviews. Indeed, the only "expert" participant—the participant who had published writing related to his technology diet—was, unsurprisingly, a white male. But along those lines of homogeneity, the entire sample self-identified as white/caucasian. This could not be so easily reinterpreted as a blessing disguised as a curse. To this, I can only suggest this: such are the dangers of convenience and snowball sampling. Unconscious bias, either through the viral spread of the event's invitations, or on my part through the solicitation and contact process, resulted in such a racially homogenous sample. Analysing the causes for this are well outside the scope of this study, but it merits serious discussion—something addressed later in the Conclusion.

*Of the ten participants from the college, there was a typical degree of diversity in terms of socioeconomic background, despite the lack of racial diversity in the sample. Participants' parents' educations ranged from high school degrees to doctorates, though most had achieved Bachelor's or Master's degrees. Participants were not asked about their socioeconomic backgrounds directly; they were asked about their status regarding financial aid and work/study programs as a proxy, with participants self-describing across all of the available categories.*

When research was concluded, eleven interviews had been conducted. Of that number, eleven were "normal" computer users; students of The College of Wooster, all had self-described themselves as reasonably technologically proficient. The remaining one participant was my sole "expert" respondent—one of those who had announced their intentions to undertake a "technology diet" and had documented their experiences publicly. To reiterate: though they had published publicly about their experiences, it was made clear in our initial contact that his anonymity would be protected, so as to encourage the sharing of any details not fit for public consumption. Throughout this analysis, each of these respondents will be referred to by pseudonym. To protect their privacy and anonymity, particular details have been changed or omitted within standard and reasonable expectation.

# Analysis

Listed in the previous chapter, three hypotheses informed the how the interviews were designed and conducted. However, as I coded and analysed the data, four themes made themselves apparent. In this section, each of these themes will be analysed and discussed with respect to the theories already examined in this study. While participants had data relevant to each section, some of their responses were more poignant or relevant to specific themes at hand. *First, the broad narratives and backgrounds of the participants will be examined.* Then, each of the recurring themes will be discussed with respect to variety of experiences had by the participants. Once each of these themes has been established and discussed, only then will we evaluate each of the three hypotheses mentioned prior. 

Despite the variation in participants' backgrounds, their personal narratives around technology were astoundingly similar.  While specific circumstances varied, 

## A Broad Narrative

The first interview conducted was with the "expert" participant, Chris. Chris, born in 1986, is substantially older than the rest of the sample—a full three years older than the next-eldest participant, and five years older than the sample average. Unsurprisingly, many of the specifics of his experiences and interactions with technology differed from those of the rest of the sample. But throughout research process, his narrative of technology adoption became the predominant narrative across all participants—albeit with slight differences in relative age. 

For either business or pleasure, the family would purchase a home computer from the ages of six to eight—quickly followed by the introduction of computers into their schools. Computers at home were used primarily for games, either educational or recreational, while computers at school were used in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades for typing classes and small research projects. Fascinatingly, virtually all of the participants—with the exception of Chris—were unable to remember the first time they used the Internet. In Chris' case, his first experience was in school for a research project; but for the rest of the participants, the Internet had more or less always been around in school or in the home. While the "digital native" descriptor is typically used hyperbolically, it would appear that there is some truth at its root. When asked if he remembered his first experiences using a computer or using the Internet, Ernesto—the youngest participant of the sample—responded: 

> "No, I just… in my mind, it's always been a thing. I don't remember, like, you know the first time I really used a computer, I don't remember the first time I really used the Internet; it's just something that I've just become… it's just second nature. I remember the exciting transition from dial-up Internet, I don't know…"

For this generation, and the generations following it, a world without global telecommunications or the Internet may as well have never existed.

Following these early experiences with computers came the cellphone. As if preordained, every participant received a cellphone at the ages of fourteen or fifteen for the explicit purpose contacting parents—again, with the exception of Chris, who received his at the age of sixteen. From this point onward, the narrative becomes broader: participants received or purchased their own computers either in the later years of high school or in preparation for college, and new cellphones were purchased according to personal preference and circumstances like service contracts, accidents, etc. Smartphone adoption across the sample was in line with recent estimates mentioned in the Introduction—about seventy percent market saturation—but none of the respondents were without phones, and even expressed mild horror at the prospect.

## Computer Education & Early Childhood

Perhaps the clearest point of comparison between Turkle's findings and my own is childhood and computer education. To say the transformation in computer education and interaction between 1984 and the late 90's was radical would be an enormous understatement. Most of the schools Turkle observed only had a few computers: "one or perhaps two computers per grade. In a few, every classroom had at least one computer." (2005:93). However, a private school she called "Austen" quickly became a primary focus for her analysis. At Austen, students were given unlimited access to computers—a decision made very intentionally. Turkle summarised: "This is not a school that "brought in some computers," but a school that created conditions for the growth of a computer culture. The intention was to simulate a future where computers would be everyday objects in the life of the child." (2005:94). Indeed, the other schools studied could not afford such a large number of computers and relied on traditional pedagogic relationships between teachers and children, but the underlying assumptions were the same: computers were the future, and they would be everywhere. As such, children needed to understand the essentials of programming through simple code languages like BASIC, PILOT, and Logo (2005:93). 

Those underlying assumptions could not have been more wrong. While all the participants reported their schools as having large numbers of computers—either in classrooms or in specialised computer labs—the intent and structure of computer education had changed. When Turkle originally published her findings, the revolution in computing user interfaces was just about to begin with the introduction of the Macintosh. In a few short years, knowledge of programming would be eliminated as a prerequisite for computer use. Introducing the revised edition in 2005, she summarised these changes as such:

> "Schoolchildren learning to program under innovative educational initiatives of twenty years ago, such as Deborah, are among this book's central actors. So, too, is a vibrant culture of personal computer owners who built and bought home computers for the joy of understanding how they worked. But in today's cultural mainstream, these actors are no longer with us. The socially shared activity of computer programming and hardware tinkering has been displaced by playing games, participation in online chat and blogs, and using applications software out of the box." (2005:5)

Of the participants interviewed for this study, all described their early experiences in the classroom as such: research projects and typing classes, with the most complex projects consisting of designing simple websites. Debby, a female participant whose father had owned a computer for several years, recalled one of her earliest experiences in the classroom:

> "For whatever reason, I was… I had a really weird fourth grade teacher. He wanted us to be creating some really, really basic website… And I just remember the concept of copying and pasting, like, hyperlinks was difficult for me… and that I didn't quite understand what the point was."

To members of our generation, being that young and having a problem copying and pasting text is unsurprising—perhaps even a source of sympathy. But it clashes jarringly with the students Turkle observed only fifteen years before. In discussing the behaviours and phenomena surrounding child programmers, Turkle begins with Robin. Robin, four years old and in a nursery school, is described as "playing a game that allows her to build stick figures by commanding the computer to make components appear and move into a desired position. The machine responds to Robin's commands and tells her when it does not understand an instruction." (2005:91). But unlike the computer games of the 90's, Robin was able to do all this by typing commands into the machine, rather than pointing and clicking—a stunning contrast to Debby's experience.

As powerful as Turkle's conceptualisation of the computer as an evocative object was at the time, it seems to have been diminished. With respect to the narrative established in Chapter One, the introduction of the GUI transformed the experience of using a computer. It was a double-edged sword: while the GUI lowered the bar of entry to using a computer by reducing the complexity of its operation, it inadvertently made it more difficult for children and adolescents to experiment or express themselves. While teachers were no longer so easily outsmarted by their students, applications and programs designed for specific purposes instituted hard limits on their usage—resulting in the goal-oriented and productively-minded computer classes meant to teach basic skills and nothing more. In many ways, the experience of using a computer was refocussed through the adult context:

> "Adults are more settled. In the worst of cases, they are locked into roles, afraid of the new, and protective of the familiar. Even when they are open to change, established ways of thinking act as a braking force on the continual questioning so characteristic of children… Some people are intimidated by computers and keep their distance. Others see them merely "as a tool" and assimilate them into their nine-to-five life." (2005:155).

And so, by the time these participants had reached middle and high school, computers had largely been rendered as means for either consumption of media (predominantly video games) or production (school assignments).

## The Global Village and Contemporary Telecommunications

As was discussed prior, Marshall McLuhan was remarkably successful in hypothesising what effects a global telecommunications infrastructure might have—if not the specific forms it would take, like the Internet. While the Internet was a far-off phenomenon in the writing of *The Second Self*, and an imminent source of strife in *Alone Together*, my research confirmed the dramatic transformation that took place in the period between each of those texts. Of the ten participants from the college, none of them could recall their first experience using the Internet.
