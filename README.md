# The-Smart-phone--Self
=====================

New repo for my I.S. as I reorganise my file system. Nothing to see here.

# This is an experiment.
I am currently writing my Senior Independent Study at The College of Wooster on smartphones and their role in personal development and social life. Relative to my department, I'm pretty big on technologyâ€”so, I've decided to take my work and track it here. Anyone is free to comment, but I will be keeping control over commits (I'm not trying to crowdsource this project). This is an experiment in writing, editing, and publishing. Join me?

*To-do:*
* Actually fix/finish this?
