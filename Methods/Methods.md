## Introduction

At its broadest this study asks, "what role does the smartphone play in contemporary social life?". We have examined a range of theories and approaches, from historically-deterministic accounts of Fordism to radical reconfigurations of what constitutes a social actor. This study was not meant to deliver significant or conclusive evidence toward any given understanding of computers or the smartphone; instead, this research was meant to examine reactions to and interactions with these devices at a personal level. As such, the methods chosen for this research were individual interviews and autoethnography. First, we shall discuss the decision between qualitative and quantitative methods and the rationale behind choosing each methodology. Then I will explain the particulars of each methodology in detail, and how that influenced the collection and analysis of results.

Quantitative methods are an essential part of any social scientist's tool kit. However, it is my belief that such an approach fails to serve the purposes of this study. While counting the hours spent using computers or the number of times is important to understanding behaviours and practices surrounding them, it does not question the structures or institutions responsible nor does it question the underlying logic responsible. Studying the comings and goings of the tide seldom tells you much about the Earth or the Moon. 


On the other hand, qualitative research fails to provide evidence which is definitive or significant. However, it does allow for a richer discussion of themes and concepts which are not easily conceptualised or measured. As the goal of this study was not to prove—but to explore through extensive and expansive questioning and prodding—qualitative methods were the obvious choice.

But why interviews? And why autoethnography? To answer the first, I turn to Turkle. Her research was deeply influential in my own thinking, and demonstrated the advantages of qualitative analysis of social life around computers. Her background in psychology is better-suited to understanding the experiences of subjects and how that might be explained through theory, but that methodology is also suited to examining the theories we have discussed.
