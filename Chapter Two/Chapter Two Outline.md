# Abstract/Thesis
Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" was a seminal work in feminist theory which challenged many of feminism's most sacrosanct principles. However, for the purposes of this research, it is also important to note it was a profound assault on social theories which depended on essentialism and unilateralism. More specifically, it challenged the gradual shift that had begun to take place in the computing community; instead of being seen as tools constituted of discrete parts, computers began their transformation into singular and autonomous entities of nigh-magical ability. In this chapter, I would contend that the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and other, "natural" interfaces have transformed our relationship to computers in a fundamental fashion. Where computers were once tools—extensions of the self, to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan—smartphones and other devices are popularly conceived as angry and buzzing hellions dedicated to totalising our collective time and attention. Essentialism and the oppressive deference of contemporary smartphones have resulted in a state of moral panic.
# basics
- what is an evocative object, and how does the computer fit in? 
- - "an object which prompts self-reflection… …Computers brought philosophy down to earth. Even children playing with the first generation of computer toys and games were asking new questions about the machine's "life" and "mind" and then, by extension, wondering what was special about their own." (*The Second Self* pg. ~2)
- - the computer exists in the space between alive and dead; it mimics sentience while remaining thoroughly non-biological
- how did the computer reshape how we see ourselves?
- - Turkle uses a number of psychological frames to understand computers' role in development, adolescence, and adult life, but her views are dated (the command-line interfaces of the 1970's and 80's gave way to graphical user interfaces which dramatically reshaped the average computing experience)
- - I contend the average computing experience for most people when using smartphones does not empower the user, and has caused us to re-frame our understanding of ourselves (because of the computer's status as an evocative object).
# The programmable home computer
## a brief history of computing:
The best place to start is the beginning. While this research concerns itself with the smartphone in contemporary life, it is essential to understand how the personal computer—the PC—came about, and how programmers and users reacted to these new tools. During the war, an enormous amount of capital was invested by the U.S. military in developing new technologies. California's San Fernando valley soon became a hotbed of aerospace and radio research, but it was the wave of innovation that came after which would give it the moniker it goes by today: Silicon Valley. 

After hostilities had ceased, engineers found themselves well-off and in a large community of like-minded innovators. It was in this intellectually fertile environment that the semiconductor, the integrated circuit, and the microprocessor1 were invented amidst a wave of experimentation and exploration. These technologies, born from stories of genius and betrayal worthy of Greek tragedy, allowed companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Atari, and Intel to start defining what the desktop PC would look like. Research conducted in nearby labs and universities stoked the fires of invention even further, and the computer market—once dominated by huge enterprises and institutions—found itself racing to the bottom. It was the 1970's, and the fight for everyday computing had begun.
## Turkle and *The Second Self* 
- computers were originally programmable and allowed for the creation of "micro worlds", profoundly empowering spaces in which users felt in control
- - Seymour Papert's "the computer as pencil" is an apt image for what computers were; they were tools meant for any variety of purposes, and could lead to dramatically different results in the hands of different people.
- - Henry carried unhappy social relationships into his computer use; it is exclusionary, rather than collaborative [lending support to my hypothesis: it is not the machines, how we are shaped and what we do with them.]
- - the inversion of the student-teacher relationship at Austen [the school Turkle studied, which took the dramatic leap of installing computers for every student and built in free programming time] is demonstrative of my opening assertion: computers were profoundly empowering. E.g. "They can be given a speed and a direction and be set in motion. The direction is usually specified in terms of a heading from 0 to 360, where 0 would point the sprite due north, 90 would point it due east, 180 south, 270 west, and 360 north again. At the time the system was introduced, the teachers thought the manipulation of headings would be too complex for second graders because it involves the concept of angles, so these children were introduced to the commands for making sprites appear, giving them shapes and colors, and placing them on the screen, but not for setting them in motion. Motion would be saved for later grades. The curriculum held for two weeks. That is, it held until one second grader, Gary, caught on to the fact that something exciting was happening on the older children's screens, and knew enough to pick up the trick from a proud and talkative third grader. In one sense, the teachers were right: Gary didn't understand that what he was dealing with were "angles." He didn't have to. He wanted to make the computer do something, and he found a way to assimilate the concept of angle to something he already knew-secret codes. "The sprites have secret codes, like 10, 100, 55. And if you give them their codes they go in different directions. I've taught the code to fourteen second graders," he confided to a visitor. "We're sort of keeping it a secret. The teachers don't know. We haven't figured out all the codes yet, but we're working on it." Two weeks later, Gary and his friends were still cracking the code. "We're still not sure about the big numbers" (sprites interpret 361 as 1, one full revolution plus 1), but they were feeling very pleased with themselves." (*The Second Self* pg. ~96-97) [see also the example of Ronnie on pg. ~115 (using variables without understanding the concept of a variable)]
- in Turkle's analysis, it becomes immediately apparent that social life was already changing substantially [as can be seen in the above examples]:
- - even early on, computers were "disrupting our senses of propriety or nature"; take the example of Robin typing: "We find it easy to accept, indeed we are proud, when children develop physical skills or the ability to manipulate concrete materials earlier than we expect. But a basic change in the child's manipulation of symbolic materials threatens something deep. Central to our notion of childhood is the idea that children of Robin's age and younger speak but do not write." Sherry Turkle. The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (pg. ~92). Kindle Edition. [Turkle also mentions Jean-Jacques Rousseau believing writing is a loss of innocence; he was and is full of shit. "state of nature" arguments are garbage.]
- - perhaps instinctively, people felt unnerved by computers. Contrary to McLuhan's axiom ("the medium is the message"), TV watchers are predominantly concerned with the media being displayed because we are passive.
- - Turkle's primary conceit is that rather than computers having a  "isolable" and universal effect on children's development, different children will make different things of the computer itself. [leading us back to Papert's earlier assertion]
- Turkle establishes two primary frames of reference: gender, and "hard" and "soft" mastery
- - hard mastery falls in line with mastery of formal systems and abstract thinking; soft mastery is compared to *bricolage*/*the bricoleur*. Both are gendered extensively here through Freudian psychology (specifically a [garbage] oedipal narrative)
- - hard mastery: the protozoan "hacker" culture that developed in groups of boys who were particularly good programmers; did not care about visual aesthetics, only cared for technical feats
- - - [observation: hard masters think in abstractions, better fit McLuhan's "extensions of man"; soft masters are more like the users of today in that they rely on direct analogy and metaphor to physical reality]
- - soft mastery: more concerned with experiential interaction with computers, increased reliance on anthropomorphisation and direct metaphors to "real" life:
- - - ""When I program I put myself in the place of the sprite. And I make it do things."" Sherry Turkle. The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (p. 98). Kindle Edition. [the larger example of Kevin and Jeff is essential #extensionofself
- - - [interesting] Anne refers to the computer as a "he" and sees it as "sort of alive" because it responds to inputs; more extreme is Tanya, who anthropomorphized the computer completely (a *demiperson*)
## Conclusions
- Turkle's observations make it clear that the computer plays an important role in development, and takes on similar—though slightly evolved—roles later in adolescence and adulthood [would adding this be too unwieldy? adolescence focuses primarily on conception and definition of the self, while adulthood is centred on the development of culture and subculture around AI and machine intelligence]
- Turkle's examples from Austen demonstrate exactly how computers were capable of mediating social life—though this differs substantially from what we might see today because of the changes in interface paradigms, detailed in the next section

# The cyborg self
## another brief history of computing
- at this stage of the commodification of the computer, the introduction of the GUI had made computers vastly more accessible and straightforward by relying on 1:1 metaphors (skeumorphic design artefacts)
## Cyborg theory as a response to essentialism
- the cyborg as an assault on essentialism and the politics of identity
- - rather than clinging to dualisms and systems of understanding generated from the existing "informatics of domination", we ought to move to a new system of knowledge and understanding that is thoroughly grounded in a subjective social location rather  than objective physical reality. 
- while Turkle is correct in believing that some technologists have done too far in calling for borderline human relationship s with computers, she comes from a thoroughly reactionary essentialist position—evident in *Alone Together*, which functions well as academic literature but also gives off airs of moral panic
- - 
# The 7th Kingdom - Kevin Kelly and why McLuhan was right all along
- technology has become increasingly commodified in contemporary society
- Marxist interpretations begin to address this, but the larger picture is altogether more complex
- McLuhan's suggestion of self-aware and self-critical use of technology has manifested itself in two theorists: Kevin Kelly in *What technology Wants* and Sherry Turkle in *Alone Together*
- Turkle
- - Turkle believes that the use of technology has spiralled out of control; I would agree. the "holding power" of technology has spiralled out of control as a result of rampant commodification and alienation
- - she has called for "digital diets", which I think are an important step forward and a model for future use of technology
- - that said, she betrays her fundamentally essentialist stance in statements such as this [paraphrased]: "cars have been regulated substantially so as to limit the damage they cause" [cars don't cause the damage, they are merely the means of doing so[problematic argument, compare to gun control]] "technology ought to be similarly restricted"
- - in saying this, she ignores the fact that the individual plays a substantial role in this process as well—we are not helpless victims in the face of technology
- Kelly
- - Kelly sees technological development much more broadly; as the development of a seventh kingdom of life that has evolved alongside higher-order lifeforms
- - as technology has evolved, it has become more complex and specialised—as such it is predisposed to certain behaviours and needs [the "want" in "*What Technology Wants*"]
- - restriction of our technology use is important and necessary, but it does not mean that we are necessarily losing ourselves [Kelly is also something of an essentialist, but is open to the idea of cyborgification]

## Clippings/Ramblings [ideas filed for later]
video games set the model for all other computing [though, arguably, children's toys set the precedent far earlier] (Second Self ~73): computers and programs became internally inaccessible (written programs became cartridges) so as to defend profits, but under the banner of being more user-friendly and accessible. this led to the GUI/"natural" revolution which transformed the computing experience from niche, empowering, and active to popular but passive [potential link to marxist alienation?]

let it be known that I am not fundamentally against the use of GUIs and other "natural" interface paradigms; they can be tremendously effective at receiving input and vastly increasing our ability to interact more efficiently with computers. that said, the movement toward those systems has traditionally beenhand-in-hand with commodification and mythologisation of technology (e.g. the cultural cachet associated with the iPhone, the first touchscreen phone and the ensuing developments in UI like Siri which goes so far as to mimic personality or sentience).





- - [hypothesis: construction of gender plays an important role in shaping responses to technology (along the hard/soft//obsessive-compulsive/hysterical); does cyborg feminism provide for this in some fashion? as gender as an institution has been somewhat softened since the 1970's, can that change be measured?]
- - [hypothesis: the oedipal justification of the masculinity/objectivity construction could be disrupted by intergenerational transmission of social behaviour—possibly via epigenetic transmission (see *Radiolab* episode "Inheritance", example of rats]
- - [Ralph and Michael are a *perfect* example of a computer mediating a relationship]

- - schizoid style (fear of intimacy, fear of being alone) might best describe our current status with machines
- - ["Build and Analyze" 107 ~14:00 - Marco as the evolution of a soft master; "programming to make a product"]
- - by moving away from specs, we have mythologised the intelligence of the machine [condescending UI which relies on 1:1 real-world metaphors—possibly bring in *Simulacra and Simulation*, Baudrillard?](*The Second Self* ~180)
- this falls in line with McLuhan's thoughts in *Understanding Media*, wherein technologies are extensions of the self
- - See "The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis"
- - we love gadgetry and technology not solely because of its utility; we love it because it is a reflection and extension of ourselves
- - McLuhan advocates self-aware and self-critical use of technology—a point we'll return to later
- however, children's toys and video games began a trend: the elimination of command line interfaces in favour of self-contained and metaphorical user interfaces ("The Condescending UI", Paul Miller) (Jarish's disappointment and loss of control in *The Second Self* ~73)
