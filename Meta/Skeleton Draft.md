# Abstract

This study examines theories used to explain human-object relationships with respect to the contemporary smartphone. From Marx to today, attitudes toward the rapidly evolving technologies we surround ourselves with have not concerned themselves with the microsociological or individual effects. Through the examination of individuals' coping mechanisms for the profoundly interconnected and computerised lives we lead today, this study recommends a new approach and theorisation of smartphones and other technologies toward a more progressive and adaptable framework.

# Introduction
*Establishes the main themes and ideas of the study.*

# A History of Technology, Computing, and the Smartphone
*Familiarises the reader with the relative leaps made in computers and technological progress in the past century, and the history behind the smartphone today.*

## Brief history of computing
[needs substantial reworking and sources; however, as it is a non-critical overview, it should be simple to expand and revise. Also, footnotes were included in the original draft and did not port over properly.]The best place to start is the beginning. While this research concerns itself with the smartphone in contemporary life, it is essential to understand how the personal computer—the PC—came about, and how programmers and users reacted to these new tools. During the war, an enormous amount of capital was invested by the U.S. military in developing new technologies. California's San Fernando valley soon became a hotbed of aerospace and radio research, but it was the wave of innovation that came after which would give it the moniker it goes by today: Silicon Valley. 	After hostilities had ceased, engineers found themselves well-off and in a large community of like-minded innovators. It was in this intellectually fertile environment that the semiconductor, the integrated circuit, and the microprocessor1 were invented amidst a wave of experimentation and exploration. These technologies, born from stories of genius and betrayal worthy of Greek tragedy, allowed companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Atari, and Intel to start defining what the desktop PC would look like. Research conducted in nearby labs and universities stoked the fires of invention even further, and the computer market—once dominated by huge enterprises and institutions—found itself racing to the bottom. It was the 1970's, and the fight for everyday computing had begun.## The Programmable ComputerThe potential of the PC was already well-established. Throughout the 1960's, research labs and start-ups had developed prototypes and even brought some to market2. However, price was a huge barrier and it wasn't until the homebrew movement3 that PC's were proven to be a viable product. Famously, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold the first Apple PC's as wood-enclosed computers made in Jobs' father's garage. However, these extremely crude operations soon became fully-fledged businesses and manufacturers. While still expensive, computers had become exponentially more affordable and well within the reach of the upper middle class and schools.

# Theory One
*Examines the theories of Marx, Gramsci, and Baudrillard and how they apply to the experience of the consumer in terms of alienation through technology. Ludlow's Greek God model of governance an interesting analogy.*

## Gramsci

- Greek gods forcing technology on mortals

# Theory Two
*Establishes cyborg theory as a descendant of Marxist analysis, while making significant strides away from classically determinist positions. Uses Kelly as an example of a hybrid-based theory to reorient our attitudes toward technology.*

## IntroductionDonna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" was a seminal work in feminist theory which challenged many of feminism's most sacrosanct principles. However, for the purposes of this research, it is also important to note it was a profound assault on social theories which depended on essentialism and unilateralism. More specifically, it challenged the gradual shift that had begun to take place in the computing community; instead of being seen as tools constituted of discrete parts, computers began their transformation into singular and autonomous entities of nigh-magical ability. In this chapter, I would contend that the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and other, "natural" interfaces have transformed our relationship to computers in a fundamental fashion. Where computers were once tools—extensions of the self, to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan—smartphones and other devices are popularly conceived as angry and buzzing hellions dedicated to totalising our collective time and attention. Essentialism and the oppressive deference of contemporary smartphones have resulted in a state of moral panic.
