## McLuhan

### Turkle, *The Second Self*

### Meyrowitz, *No Sense of Place*

## Turkle

perfect response by marcuse: "Does not the threat of [technology] which could wipe out [social life] also serve to protect the very forces which perpetuate this danger? The efforts to prevent such a catastrophe overshadow the search for its potential causes in contemporary industrial society… …If we attempt to relate the causes of the danger to the way in whichs society is organised and organises its members, we are immediately confronted with the fact that advanced industrial society becomes richer, bigger, and better as it perpetuates the danger." (ix).

interesting perspective from Galbraith: "And the continuing revolution in job quality being wrought by the computer is accelerating its growth." (248)

## Haraway

## Law

## Callon, Latour
