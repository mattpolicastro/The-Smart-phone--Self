*A note on the personal nature of this study, and the experience of writing it.*

## Abstract

*Original abstract, submitted in the study proposal:*

The smartphone is a relatively sudden and recent phenomenon. Through the evolution of the Blackberry, and since the introduction the of the iPhone in 2007, consumer electronics have experienced a sea change. Where the personal computer was once a series of black or beige boxes atop the desk, eminently portable and powerful computers are now in the pockets of millions around the world. The very notion of a personal computer has been radically altered.

Smartphone sales have swiftly become a business worth billions of dollars, and there is little evidence to believe this is trend is a flash in the pan. The sudden proliferation of extremely powerful computers has profound ramifications for social life. The capacity of the individual to perform tasks is greater than ever before, and smartphones function as hubs for all social interaction. Whether direct and literal extensions of the self or a particularly insidious form of consumerism and alienation, this study intends to explore the role of the smartphone in contemporary society.

## Introduction [pg. 1–?]

*Introduces the study and details a brief history of information technology.*

- the smartphone is the herald of a new era, but it is not the only focus of this study. instead, it is a lens to examine the plethora of changes and social problems that have arisen out of it.

# 2/3 - Literature Review & Theory

## Literature Review/History of Major Technological Developments

*Possibly rendered redundant by the Introduction.*

## Theory 1

*Examines and discusses Marxist analysis with respect to contemporary consumer culture via the lens of the smartphone.*

### the web is dead, long live the Internet

### Americanism, Taylorism, & Fordism

### security

### the consumer society/the socialisation of mass consumption

### capital accumulation and consolidation

### discussion of these themes with respect to technology, Greek god model of governance, a model for revolution

## Theory 2

*Provides an alternative account of technological development and interaction in human social life; also introduces cyborg theory and actor network theory as alternative systems of establishing meaning.*

### technics to technium

### turkle

### cyborg theory and actor network theory

# 4 - Methods

*Outlines the rationale behind the methods used to collect and analyse data.*

## Introduction

## Qualitative Over Quantitative

## Methodologies

### Autoethnography

### Qualitative Interviews

- participant solicitation
- - public postings
- - contact price
- interview format
- - instrument design
- - interview context (e.g. location)
- - recording medium
- - consent form/follow-up survey
- analysis
- - transcription
- - analysis w/ respect to Turkle's research

# 5 - Results

## Introduction/population description

## Data & Analysis

- - Computer education in early childhood
> > compare to Turkle's work in *The Second Self*
- - Study abroad/long distance communications
> > autoethnography of time spent abroad and technological anxiety in the United States; compare to McLuhan and the global village
- - Technology "addiction" and coping mechanisms; technology diets
> > cf. to Turkle in *Alone Together*
- - Commodification and corporatism in consumer technology; Google Glass
> > examine attitudes of participants as well as a Marxist analysis of means of consumption

## Suggestions/Predictions

### The devolution of technology as a revolutionary ideology

*A look at products like Makerbot, crowdsourcing, and App.net. there is a growing movement away from the monolithic structures of Facebook and others as their abrogations of privacy and objectification/alienation become better-known.*

- In general, we have come to accept current, specific applications of computer technology as inevitable. We lose sight of the fact that things were once different and might have developed along other paths if different decisions had been taken by manufacturers and consumers, by educators and governments. Yet, if we hope to construct Sherry Turkle. The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (p. 4). Kindle Edition. 

### Claptrap's New Robot Revolution
*The status of computers as marginal objects will grow only more complicated as robots become larger parts of our lives.*

- Alone Together's sections on robots
- Robots like [Baxter](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/index.php/products/baxter/) [which rolls into the next section]

### Feminism in tech

*The subculture of technology is even more oppressive than larger society. Self-critique is rare w/ respect to issues like gender/sexuality/diversity, the environment, or alternative arrangements of social life.*

## re-writing the self

McLuhan showed us how extensively we have rewritten ourselves, while Haraway showed us the freedom of moving away from binaries. ANT and API's. media studies will be critical to understanding the transformations occurring within the self. there is the very real threat of media and technological progress completely outstripping our biology, which still moves slowly. but our conclusions regarding the smartphones are as such: the possibilities offered by cyborg theory are encouraging to say the least. class consciousness within the consumer society is the ultimate end goal, but that process is a long one. the first step is to subvert the means of consumption: jailbreaking phones, remixing content, pushing back against the corporatist influence as manifested by corporations themselves and the state.

- Thus, this book became a study of a culture in the making. A computer culture that in one way or another touches us all. And because it affects our lives in so many ways, this book takes its questions about this nascent culture from many perspectives.
