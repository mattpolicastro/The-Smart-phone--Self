# Abstract

This study examines theories used to explain human-object relationships with respect to the contemporary smartphone. From Marx to today, attitudes toward the rapidly evolving technologies we surround ourselves with have not concerned themselves with the microsociological or individual effects. Through the examination of individuals' coping mechanisms for the profoundly interconnected and computerised lives we lead today, this study recommends a new approach and theorisation of smartphones and other technologies toward a more progressive and adaptable framework.
