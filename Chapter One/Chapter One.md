# Introduction

The world which Marx describe in his writing is obviously different from our own. However, the ideas he elaborated then are absolutely essential to understanding our own society now. While many of the specifics have changed, Marx's broad strokes regarding alienation, oppression, and conflict remain undoubtedly true today. By examining the work of later theorists—Gramsci, Baudrillard, and Aglietta, primarily—I hope to build a narrative explaining our relatively fraught relationship with computers and information technology. For the purposes of this study, the smartphone will be the most commonly cited point of reference [the smartphone is quickly becoming the most-often used computing device for the vast majority of the world, and, as such, is perhaps the most relatable]. While the creators of the computer saw it as a tool of empowerment and even liberation, the layperson sees it as mundane or even as a malignant presence. Our current condition was brought about by the confluence of three historical trends as identified by Marx:

*a) the alienation and objectification of the individual*

*b) the redefinition of collective values by capitalist activity*

*c) the consolidation and accumulation of capital*

Despite their separation, they are all deeply interconnected and are manifestations of the changing face of society. However, they are useful distillations of the themes and theories analysed in this chapter. Again, while Marx's specifics may no longer be applicable, his writing forms a touchstone from which later works better outline our current relationships to ourselves, each other, and the technologies which surround us.

## Americanism, Taylorism, & Fordism

Despite being held as a political prisoner by the Italian Fascist party, Antonio Gramsci was able to analyse and elaborate the enormous changes occurring on the American side of the Atlantic. While Marx had outlined the specific modes of varieties of alienation and exploitation, Gramsci provided a thorough and articulate account of American industry's effects on the worker at the time. After World War I, it was clear the changes taking place in the United States were bleeding over into European culture—the results of which prompted Gramsci's reflections on this potential new epoch of industrial life.

The aristocratic classes—kindly termed "parasites" by Gramsci and his contemporaries—were in a precarious position. The industrial revolution had been kind to the United States, and Europe wished to "have a full barrel and a drunken wife" inasmuch that it wished to match American productive capacity while maintaining its traditional aristocracy and attendant social classes (1971:564). While arguments of the time defended the existing class and social structures, Gramsci made quick work of them; cities across Europe had become rife with marginally productive citizens as consequence of law, custom, or tradition. In contrast, the United States did not have "this leaden burden to support"; something evident in Weber's Protestant work ethic prevalence across all sections of American society (1971:570). In effect, American industry developed in a relative vacuum, free to evolve and experiment with new and highly productive relationships between firms and workers.

Rationalism was the new order of the day, and was seized upon by men like Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford. Practices like vertical integration (the stratification and alignment of means of production along one firm's holdings and interests) made leaps and bounds in productivity and efficiency. Unions and skilled labour were subverted by the attractive wages and benefits that were offered by those improvements. Gramsci realised that the factory had become the epicentre of a new hegemony, where "the whole life of the nation revolve[d] around production" (1971:571).

As factory activity became the centre of productive life after World War I, *present complaints of "work-life imbalance" are rendered pathetic.* Rather than simple attempts at "puritanism", Gramsci made it clear that firms' invasion of workers' private lives was the manifestation of something else entirely: "the biggest collective effort to date to create, with unprecedented speed, and with a consciousness of purpose unmatched in history, a new type of worker and of man" (1971:597). He continues:

> "It is from this point of view that one should study the "puritanical" initiative of American industrialists like Ford. It is certain that they are not concerned with the "humanity" or the "spirituality of the worker, which are immediately smashed. This "humanity and spirituality" cannot be realised except in the world of production and work and in productive "creation". They exist most in the artisan, in the "demiurge", when the worker's personality was reflected whole in the object created and when the link between art and labour was still very strong. But it is precisely against this "humanism" that the new industrialism is fighting. "Puritanical" initiatives simply have the purpose of preserving, outside of work, a certain psycho-physical equilibrium which prevents the physiological collapse of the worker, exhausted by the new method of production… …It is in their interests to have a stable, skilled labour force, a permanently well-adjusted complex, because the human complex (the collective worker) of an enterprise is also a machine which cannot, without considerable loss, be taken to pieces too often and renewed with single new parts." (Gramsci 1971:599)

Thusly, state and society adjusted to eliminate that which might deteriorate the "worker complex" through prohibition: alcohol, sexual deviance, etc. (1971:600). The Ford Motor Company eventually overreached in its meddling in the lives of its employees, but Fordism itself had become fully formed in its ability and desire to intervene in social life to maximise productivity. While Marx had articulated the methods by which the worker was alienated, those methods were more or less inherent. Fordism, however, was something else altogether: the actions it took toward the worker were intentional and designed toward maximum productivity. Gramsci conceded that this was progressive and beneficial in some respects, but that the time had come for a new "fundamental question": not of hegemony over Europe, but of hegemony *within* the United States (1971:572).

# A Society Changed

Despite some reservations, Gramsci was certain that Americanism and Fordism would leave their mark on the world. While other thinkers concerned themselves with the "new beacon of civilisation [that] has been lit over there", Gramsci openly derided them and instead stated:

> "The problem is not whether in America there exists a new civilisation, a new culture, even if only as a “beacon”, and whether it is invading or has invaded Europe. If the problem were to be posed in that way, the answer would be simple: no, it does not exist, and indeed all that they do in America is to remasticate the old European culture. The problem is rather this; whether America, through the implacable weight of its economic production (and therefore indirectly), will compel or is already compelling Europe to overturn its excessively antiquated economic and social basis." (1971:620-21).

Gramsci recognised it was not a question of cultural dominance—it was the transformation of social relationships to reflect productive capacity. Furthermore, he recognised it was too soon to know exactly how the hyper-productive American society would make itself known elsewhere—a question answered soon after World War II.

While the United States was relatively free of tradition or custom after World War I, the events of World War II firmly placed the Fordist vision at the centre of the American worldview. The government and industry aligned themselves to maximise production in support of the war effort, and Fordism tacitly became the foundation of all social life thereafter. Much like Europe's transition to relatively static aristocracy and social classes, American society oriented itself entirely around the preservation of its productive capacity. In the ashes of the post-war world, the United States stood alone in its ability to rebuild—it would have been irresponsible not to do so.

With this outwardly reasonable appearance, the United States entered a golden age where mechanisation and production were at all time highs. Gross Domestic Product had become the measure of success, and thinkers like John Kenneth Galbraith were no exception. While Galbraith was loath to be associated with Marxism or any of its related theories, he intentionally and inadvertently articulated many of the immediate problems this transition wrought. *The Affluent Society* betrays the thinking of the period quite succinctly: production was the end-all, be-all of a nation's well-being, and all other social forces could be quite quickly related back to the enormous industrial engines of capital growth. 

In this respect, Fordism had succeeded re-orienting social life around work. Galbraith speaks of a "New Class" which was meant to escape the dull and demeaning work of industrial production toward careers that were fulfilling and meaningful. Work weeks were declining as a consequence of growing productivity and the emphasis was no longer placed on production and acquisition of necessary commodities, but on the "rewards and importance of leisure" (1998:243). It is here that another fundamental transition was taking place. While public and theoretical discourse was concerned with production almost exclusively, the actual engines of economic activity were reconfiguring themselves. While the United States had been amply able to supply the rest of Western world's needs after the war, the recovering economies of Europe were resulting in over-production and rapid decreases in marginal productivity. Indeed, rather than satiating the fundamental needs of a society, "productive energies [were] used to make things of no great urgency—things for which demand must be synthesised at elaborate cost lest they not be wanted" (1998:217). In this historical moment, the value of the individual was transitioning from their productive capacity to their consumptive capacity. The consumer society was born.

# The Consumer Society

It was from *The Affluent Society* that Jean Baudrillard began his analysis of the present sources of alienation in society.

*Baudrillard works extensively with the ideas examined by Galbraith but approaches them from another direction entirely. By theorising consumer demands as something instilled, rather than innate, Baudrillard manages to answer the crisis of confidence identified by Galbraith. Furthermore, Baudrillard begins to identify in broad terms the ways and means of the new Fordism: how needs are created and spread, while production becomes a means of sustaining the generation of those "needs".*

## Aglietta: A Theory of Capitalist Regulation

*Where Baudrillard speaks broadly and harshly, Aglietta defines and discusses at length with economics of precision. The problems of Neo-Fordism are explained at length, and he provides an account of the other forces responsible for our current state of oppression through technology: centralisation and competition for capital.*

Neo-Fordism: "An articulation between process of production and mode of consumption" (117)

Where Gramsci saw the potential for abuse, Aglietta knew it in detail. Through *A Theory of Capitalist Regulation*, Michel Aglietta performed a rigourous analysis of Fordism's

### Accumulation and concentration of wealth

- Has precedent in Marx (*Capital*: Volume One: Chapter 32: The Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation) and Gramsci (his study of the women of wealthy ruling classes in "Rationalisation of Production and Work").

*The accumulation and centralisation of capital leaves firms larger and better able to dictate the terms of the society. The computer industry—once a cottage industry—would give way to these models as these tools were better recognised as means of extracting value from knowledge work.*

*Attempts to roll back concentration are consistently met with claims of "smothering innovation" or "killing jobs" (Crawford KL 204). Ecohes Galbraith's analysis that the dominant frame of analysis is productivity, though the actual benefits are heightened consumption, a la Baudrillard.*

## Ludlow: The Greek God Model of Governance

*Ludlow's writing focusses almost entirely on outright oppression, but embodies the reality of the present: corporations have enormous power over the lives of their workers and consumers. Mere mortals (those very workers and consumers) are left more powerless than ever before as virtually all their choices and opportunities are determined by the movements of the corporate deities above them. From phone contracts to App Stores, the current state of technology is a realisation of dystopia and the actualisation of the corporation's influence on the individual's life.*

## Marcuse

*Marcuse is very much a departure—a critical theorist among Marxists—but his text, **One Dimensional Man**, contains virtually all of these concerns. His chapters—"The New Forms of Control", "From Negative to Positive Thinking: Technological Rationality and the Logic of Domination", and "The Catastrophe of Liberation"—explain our current dilemma and provide a succinct coda for this chapter. In conclusion, our computers have become subject to capitalism and are essential to the ongoing processes of alienation and value extraction around which society now revolves. 

## Conclusions

**Important themes: (corporative) systems, as they take on history, transition to preservation rather than propulsion (583). In the case of industry and technology, monopolisation and consolidation has become the norm. In American and Fordist culture, caste systems arose due to surplus value and productive capacity among ruling classes (603) [see Baudrillard and systems of penury]. Surplus value and productive capacity inevitably result in castes—though in the American context, labour saving devices created a large consumer class that was still reasonably productive (shifting the lower castes of society out of the U.S. into a global context). That said, change is still possible (even the most tightly swathed baby managed to develop and grow) (584).**
