# Theory One
*Examines the theories of Marx, Gramsci, and Baudrillard and how they apply to the experience of the consumer in terms of alienation through technology. Ludlow's Greek God model of governance an interesting analogy.*

## Marx

When considering smartphones—and particularly the iPhone—many leap to Marx, exclaiming, "what an example of commodity fetishism!". While correct in that these products are highly fetishised commodities, this response is reductive. Marx's work was essential to the critical discourse that came after it, but fails to grasp contemporary realities of production and consumption in fundamental fashions. Furthermore, Marx's preemption of his own, predicted revolution left him without knowledge of the specific manifestations of alienation in a post-Taylor, post-Ford society.

## Gramsci: Prison Notebook 22

*Establishes the theory of Fordism and thoroughly critiques the growing American culture of corporate paternalism—a trend that has taken on new life in the digital domain.*

Despite being held as a political prisoner by the Italian Fascist party, Antonio Gramsci was able to analyse and elaborate the enormous changes occurring on the American side of the Atlantic. While Marx had outlined the specific modes of varieties of alienation and exploitation, Gramsci provided a thorough and articulate account of American industry's effects on the worker at the time. After World War I, it was clear the changes taking place in the United States were bleeding over into European culture—the results of which prompted Gramsci's reflections on this potential new epoch of industrial life.

### Americanism and Fordism

Aristocratic classes—kindly termed "parasites" by Gramsci and his contemporaries—were in a precarious position. The industrial revolution had been kind to the United States, and Europe wished to "have a full barrel and a drunken wife" inasmuch that it wished to match American productive capacity while maintaining its traditional aristocracy and attendant social classes (1971:564). While arguments of the time defended the existing class and social structures, Gramsci made quick work of them; cities across Europe had become rife with marginally productive citizens as consequence of law, custom, or tradition. In contrast, the United States did not have "this leaden burden to support"; something evident in Weber's Protestant work ethic prevalence across all sections of American society (1971:570). In effect, American industry developed in a relative vacuum, free to evolve and experiment with new and highly productive relationships between firms and workers.

Rationalism was the new order of the day, and was seized upon by men like Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford. Practices like vertical integration (the stratification and alignment of means of production along one firm's holdings and interests) made leaps and bounds in productivity and efficiency. Unions and skilled labour were subverted by the attractive wages and benefits that were offered by those improvements. Gramsci realised that the factory had become the epicentre of a new hegemony, where "the whole life of the nation revolve[d] around production" (1971:571).

As factory activity became the centre of productive life after World War I, *present complaints of "work-life imbalance" are rendered pathetic.* Rather than simple attempts at "puritanism", Gramsci made it clear that firms' invasion of workers' private lives was the manifestation of something else entirely: "the biggest collective effort to date to create, with unprecedented speed, and with a consciousness of purpose unmatched in history, a new type of worker and of man" (1971:597). He continues:

> "It is from this point of view that one should study the "puritanical" initiative of American industrialists like Ford. It is certain that they are not concerned with the "humanity" or the "spirituality of the worker, which are immediately smashed. This "humanity and spirituality" cannot be realised except in the world of production and work and in productive "creation". They exist most in the artisan, in the "demiurge", when the worker's personality was reflected whole in the object created and when the link between art and labour was still very strong. But it is precisely against this "humanism" that the new industrialism is fighting. "Puritanical" initiatives simply have the purpose of preserving, outside of work, a certain psycho-physical equilibrium which prevents the physiological collapse of the worker, exhausted by the new method of production… …It is in their interests to have a stable, skilled labour force, a permanently well-adjusted complex, because the human complex (the collective worker) of an enterprise is also a machine which cannot, without considerable loss, be taken to pieces too often and renewed with single new parts." (Gramsci 1971:599)

Thusly, state and society adjusted to eliminate that which might deteriorate the "worker complex" through prohibition: alcohol, sexual deviance, etc. (1971:600). Although the desire to preserve workers would take on new dimensions in the coming decades—something explained later in this paper by Aglietta and Baudrillard—this same sentiment has persevered to the present day.

### A Society Transformed

Gramsci openly wondered if the changes wrought by Ford and Taylor could be carried out across an entire society; a question that was most certainly answered during and after World War II. The whole of American society was transformed by the moral obligations of a war overseas, while government facilitated the growth of business. Fordism had perhaps overreached in its meddling with the lives of its workers, but it had set a powerful precedent—one still observed through programs like mandatory drug tests and voluntary pedometers in minimum-wage positions. Gramsci had also clearly articulated how a system such as Taylorism acted out Marx's four modes of alienation—and how thoroughly that system had formed the basis of productive activity moving forward. 

Mocking Pirandello's claims that a new civilisation had been born in America, Gramsci instead focuses on the United State's sheer productive capacity; "whether America, through the implacable weight of its economic production (and therefore indirectly), will compel or is already compelling Europe to overturn its excessively antiquated economic and basis" (1971:620-21). It is here that Gramsci makes his vies clear: that the underlying culture of American was still very much European, but a new and highly productive economic system was changing its face to something far more intense in its involvement in and alienation of the worker.

With respect to the present, his questions and predictions were prescient. American society was free of history and tradition after World War I, but the profound changes in American life brought about by World War II were plenty to generate the traditions and customs he found so loathsome in Europe. However, rather than aristocracy or new social strata, this history manifested itself in the new practices and expectations of economic activity; the balance of work and leisure; and the profoundly paternal role of the firm in the worker's life. And as the United States took its place as a global superpower, society and economic activity transitioned to preservation, rather than propulsion (Gramsci 1971:583). While Gramsci would die in prison before America fully subsumed European economic systems, his observations would make themselves clear to later thinkers such as Aglietta and Baudrillard—that American activity was "an organic extension and an intensification of European civilisation, which has simply acquired a new coating in the American climate" (1971:622).

**Important themes: (corporative) systems, as they take on history, transition to preservation rather than propulsion (583). In the case of industry and technology, monopolisation and consolidation has become the norm. In American and Fordist culture, caste systems arose due to surplus value and productive capacity among ruling classes (603). Surplus value and productive capacity inevitably result in castes—though in the American context, labour saving devices created a large consumer class that was still reasonably productive (shifting the lower castes of society out of the U.S. into a global context). That said, change is still possible (even the most tightly swathed baby managed to develop and grow) (584).**

## Aglietta

### A Theory of Capitalist Regulation

*Further explores corporate paternalism and offers a comprehensive account of its evolution in the American industrial context.*

## Baudrillard

### The Consumer Society

*An extension of Aglietta and Gramsci in critiquing the ways in which corporations drive and influence consumer life; that in fact, consumption has become the engine of society, and that society has completely internalised the consumptive prerogative that it is completely different from Marx's conceptions of production.*

## Ludlow: The Greek God Model of Governance

*Ludlow takes these themes into the present with his model of greek gods (corporations) and mortals (users). Launching-off point for examining alienation, oppression, and social life through computers and smartphones.*

Peter Ludlow's *Our Future in Virtual Worlds* is a short essay outlining his concerns with the current trajectory of development in online communities. While his confidence in the form and shape of the coming virtual worlds is misplaced (I am extremely skeptical that the web will have shifted entirely to 3D and interactive environments), his points are based in experience and are pertinent to the growing role of corporate ecosystems in smartphones. Arguing that companies have adopted a "greek god" model of governance and communities are capricious arbiters of justice, Ludlow calls for a new attitude toward transparent and consistent justice online.

Ludlow accustoms the reader to his perspective by exposing "real world" governments as virtual constructs; rather than being real, they are concepts that are generated from individuals, legislation, and policy. What, then, makes online communities any different? Their creators—rather than Enlightenment thinkers or politicians—are created by computer engineers of their own will or at the behest of companies. As a result, virtually all questions of governance have been left at the wayside in favour of externally-oriented and legally-defined Terms of Service and End User License Agreements.

Virtual worlds do not have functional justice systems. The "greek god" style of governance and justice is the haphazard and unfair system intervention by the creator when disputes arise. In the absence of such behaviour, vigilantism takes its place. Individuals or groups will form to defend values or systems as they see fit, but often end up persecuting or bullying fellow citizens of virtual worlds. Both options are utterly opaque and arbitrary, and cause individuals to lose their investment in virtual worlds: be they capital, temporal, or emotional.

I reiterate that Ludlow's argument is unnecessarily reductionist and focused on an edge case. His thought regarding the "greek god" model of governance is essential to this work, however. If the smartphone is an extension of the brain and the self, what are we to make of the corporate ecosystems which determine what smartphones are capable of, and how they may operate? Any number of features of smartphones may be constraints on organic growth, because those features are determined by a corporation under market forces. For example: app stores' guidelines. Rather than allowing software apps to develop new capacities which expand the individual's ability, the blessing of the corporation is necessary to reach the smartphone user.

Rather than considering the ramifications upon the user's rights as expressed through the smartphone, I would argue corporations are fundamentally concerned with their profit and legality while remaining tight-lipped about their internal processes. This leads to uneven and inequitable development in smartphones, and locks the augmented self onto a trajectory pre-determined by financial interests.
