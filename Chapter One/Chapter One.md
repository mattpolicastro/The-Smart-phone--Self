Marxism is a powerful tool for understanding capitalist societies. Taylorism and Fordism lead to an enormous change in how productive societies functioned. Fordism and its emphasis on production became the foundation for Western capitalist societies after World War II. Where workers were once valued for their productive output, they gradually become more important as consumers. Firms became vertically integrated and concentrated their capital to become more efficient. The result: computers were powerful tools for experimentation, but they have been thoroughly commoditised and created as devices for consumption. Huge corporate entities define the everyday lives of consumer/users as such.

# Introduction

The world which Marx describe in his writing is obviously different from our own. However, the ideas he elaborated then are absolutely essential to understanding our own society now. While many of the specifics have changed, Marx's broad strokes regarding alienation, oppression, and conflict remain undoubtedly true today. By examining the work of later theorists—Gramsci, Baudrillard, and Aglietta, primarily—I hope to build a narrative explaining our relatively fraught relationship with computers and information technology. For the purposes of this study, the smartphone will be the most commonly cited point of reference [the smartphone is quickly becoming the most-often used computing device for the vast majority of the world, and, as such, is perhaps the most relatable]. While the creators of the computer saw it as a tool of empowerment and even liberation, the layperson sees it as mundane or even as a malignant presence. Our current condition was brought about by the confluence of three historical trends as identified by Marx:

*a) the alienation and objectification of the individual*

*b) the redefinition of collective values by capitalist activity*

*c) the consolidation and accumulation of capital*

Despite their separation, they are all deeply interconnected and are manifestations of the changing face of society. However, they are useful distillations of the themes and theories analysed in this chapter. Again, while Marx's specifics may no longer be applicable, his writing forms a touchstone from which later works better outline our current relationships to ourselves, each other, and the technologies which surround us.

## Americanism, Taylorism, & Fordism

Despite being held as a political prisoner by the Italian Fascist party, Antonio Gramsci was able to analyse and elaborate the enormous changes occurring on the American side of the Atlantic. While Marx had outlined the specific modes of varieties of alienation and exploitation, Gramsci provided a thorough and articulate account of American industry's effects on the worker at the time. After World War I, it was clear the changes taking place in the United States were bleeding over into European culture—the results of which prompted Gramsci's reflections on this potential new epoch of industrial life.

The aristocratic classes—kindly termed "parasites" by Gramsci and his contemporaries—were in a precarious position. The industrial revolution had been kind to the United States, and Europe wished to "have a full barrel and a drunken wife" inasmuch that it wished to match American productive capacity while maintaining its traditional aristocracy and attendant social classes (1971:564). While arguments of the time defended the existing class and social structures, Gramsci made quick work of them; cities across Europe had become rife with marginally productive citizens as consequence of law, custom, or tradition. In contrast, the United States did not have "this leaden burden to support"; something evident in Weber's Protestant work ethic prevalence across all sections of American society (1971:570). In effect, American industry developed in a relative vacuum, free to evolve and experiment with new and highly productive relationships between firms and workers.

Rationalism was the new order of the day, and was seized upon by men like Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford. Practices like vertical integration (the stratification and alignment of means of production along one firm's holdings and interests) made leaps and bounds in productivity and efficiency. Unions and skilled labour were subverted by the attractive wages and benefits that were offered by those improvements. Gramsci realised that the factory had become the epicentre of a new hegemony, where "the whole life of the nation revolve[d] around production" (1971:571).

As factory activity became the centre of productive life after World War I, *present complaints of "work-life imbalance" are rendered pathetic.* Rather than simple attempts at "puritanism", Gramsci made it clear that firms' invasion of workers' private lives was the manifestation of something else entirely: "the biggest collective effort to date to create, with unprecedented speed, and with a consciousness of purpose unmatched in history, a new type of worker and of man" (1971:597). He continues:

> "It is from this point of view that one should study the "puritanical" initiative of American industrialists like Ford. It is certain that they are not concerned with the "humanity" or the "spirituality of the worker, which are immediately smashed. This "humanity and spirituality" cannot be realised except in the world of production and work and in productive "creation". They exist most in the artisan, in the "demiurge", when the worker's personality was reflected whole in the object created and when the link between art and labour was still very strong. But it is precisely against this "humanism" that the new industrialism is fighting. "Puritanical" initiatives simply have the purpose of preserving, outside of work, a certain psycho-physical equilibrium which prevents the physiological collapse of the worker, exhausted by the new method of production… …It is in their interests to have a stable, skilled labour force, a permanently well-adjusted complex, because the human complex (the collective worker) of an enterprise is also a machine which cannot, without considerable loss, be taken to pieces too often and renewed with single new parts." (Gramsci 1971:599)

Thusly, state and society adjusted to eliminate that which might deteriorate the "worker complex" through prohibition: alcohol, sexual deviance, etc. (1971:600). Although the desire to preserve workers would take on new dimensions in the coming decades—something explained later in this paper by Aglietta and Baudrillard—this same sentiment has persevered to the present day.

### A Society Transformed

Gramsci openly wondered if the changes wrought by Ford and Taylor could be carried out across an entire society; a question that was most certainly answered during and after World War II. The whole of American society was transformed by the moral obligations of a war overseas, while government facilitated the growth of business. Fordism had perhaps overreached in its meddling with the lives of its workers, but it had set a powerful precedent—one still observed through programs like mandatory drug tests and voluntary pedometers in minimum-wage positions. Gramsci had also clearly articulated how a system such as Taylorism acted out Marx's four modes of alienation—and how thoroughly that system had formed the basis of productive activity moving forward. 

Mocking Pirandello's claims that a new civilisation had been born in America, Gramsci instead focuses on the United State's sheer productive capacity; "whether America, through the implacable weight of its economic production (and therefore indirectly), will compel or is already compelling Europe to overturn its excessively antiquated economic and basis" (1971:620-21). It is here that Gramsci makes his vies clear: that the underlying culture of American was still very much European, but a new and highly productive economic system was changing its face to something far more intense in its involvement in and alienation of the worker.

With respect to the present, his questions and predictions were prescient. American society was free of history and tradition after World War I, but the profound changes in American life brought about by World War II were plenty to generate the traditions and customs he found so loathsome in Europe. However, rather than aristocracy or new social strata, this history manifested itself in the new practices and expectations of economic activity; the balance of work and leisure; and the profoundly paternal role of the firm in the worker's life. And as the United States took its place as a global superpower, society and economic activity transitioned to preservation, rather than propulsion (Gramsci 1971:583). 

While Gramsci would die in prison before America fully subsumed European economic systems, his observations would make themselves clear to later thinkers such as Aglietta and Baudrillard—that American activity was "an organic extension and an intensification of European civilisation, which has simply acquired a new coating in the American climate" (1971:622).

## Galbraith

*Important in recognising how thoroughly production had permeated society, but seems confused when read with respect to Marx and Gramsci. Many of the problems identified here—over-production, marginal profits—might be traced to the then-present theories of consumer demand in Ch. 10. However, Baudrillard's account of production and consumption does a much better job of explaining these phenomena.*

*Interestingly, Galbraith's interpretation of the "New Class" weirdly resembles our current state of work: primarily knowledge-based, meant to deliver fulfilment or satisfaction. Again, with respect to Marx, Gramsci, and later authors, was this something of an interregnum period? The time where Fordist capitalism, focussed on physical production, had not reoriented itself to extract value through alienation by consumption?*

John Kenneth Galbraith would likely be mortified to be bound up with the likes of Marx, Gramsci, and the other critical theorists examined here. Despite his clear distaste for their theories—calling them part of the "Marxian Pall" cast over economic analysis—*The Affluent Society* is essential to understanding how the trends identified by Gramsci manifested themselves after World War II. Namely, that the whole of society and public life was understood through notions of productivity.

## Baudrillard

### The Consumer Society

*Baudrillard works extensively with the ideas examined by Galbraith but approaches them from another direction entirely. By theorising consumer demands as something instilled, rather than innate, Baudrillard manages to answer the crisis of confidence identified by Galbraith. Furthermore, Baudrillard begins to identify in broad terms the ways and means of the new Fordism: how needs are created and spread, while production becomes a means of sustaining the generation of those "needs".

## Aglietta: A Theory of Capitalist Regulation

*Where Baudrillard speaks broadly and harshly, Aglietta defines and discusses at length with economics of precision. The problems of Neo-Fordism are explained at length, and he provides an account of the other forces responsible for our current state of oppression through technology: centralisation and competition for capital.*

Neo-Fordism: "An articulation between process of production and mode of consumption" (117)

Where Gramsci saw the potential for abuse, Aglietta knew it in detail. Through *A Theory of Capitalist Regulation*, Michel Aglietta performed a rigourous analysis of Fordism's

### Accumulation and concentration of wealth

- Has precedent in Marx (*Capital*: Volume One: Chapter 32: The Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation) and Gramsci (his study of the women of wealthy ruling classes in "Rationalisation of Production and Work").

*The accumulation and centralisation of capital leaves firms larger and better able to dictate the terms of the society. The computer industry—once a cottage industry—would give way to these models as these tools were better recognised as means of extracting value from knowledge work.*

*Attempts to roll back concentration are consistently met with claims of "smothering innovation" or "killing jobs" (Crawford KL 204). Ecohes Galbraith's analysis that the dominant frame of analysis is productivity, though the actual benefits are heightened consumption, a la Baudrillard.*

## Ludlow: The Greek God Model of Governance

*Ludlow's writing focusses almost entirely on outright oppression, but embodies the reality of the present: corporations have enormous power over the lives of their workers and consumers. Mere mortals (those very workers and consumers) are left more powerless than ever before as virtually all their choices and opportunities are determined by the movements of the corporate deities above them. From phone contracts to App Stores, the current state of technology is a realisation of dystopia and the actualisation of the corporation's influence on the individual's life.*

## Marcuse

*Marcuse is very much a departure—a critical theorist among Marxists—but his text, **One Dimensional Man**, contains virtually all of these concerns. His chapters—"The New Forms of Control", "From Negative to Positive Thinking: Technological Rationality and the Logic of Domination", and "The Catastrophe of Liberation"—explain our current dilemma and provide a succinct coda for this chapter. In conclusion, our computers have become subject to capitalism and are essential to the ongoing processes of alienation and value extraction around which society now revolves. 

## Conclusions

**Important themes: (corporative) systems, as they take on history, transition to preservation rather than propulsion (583). In the case of industry and technology, monopolisation and consolidation has become the norm. In American and Fordist culture, caste systems arose due to surplus value and productive capacity among ruling classes (603) [see Baudrillard and systems of penury]. Surplus value and productive capacity inevitably result in castes—though in the American context, labour saving devices created a large consumer class that was still reasonably productive (shifting the lower castes of society out of the U.S. into a global context). That said, change is still possible (even the most tightly swathed baby managed to develop and grow) (584).**
