# Introduction

The world which Marx describes in his writing is obviously and markedly different from our own. However, the ideas he elaborated then are absolutely essential to understanding our own society now. Marx's themes alienation, oppression, and conflict are just as relevant today as they were at the time of their writing. By examining the work of later theorists—Gramsci, Baudrillard, and Aglietta, primarily—I hope to build a narrative explaining our relatively fraught relationship with computers and information technology. While the modern smartphone is the primary focus of this study, we interact with any number of computers daily; laptops, tablets, ATMs, to name a few. 

While the architects of the modern computer saw it as a tool of empowerment and even liberation, the layperson sees it as mundane or even as a malignant presence. Our current condition was brought about by the confluence of three historical trends as identified by Marx:

*a) the alienation and objectification of the individual*

*b) the redefinition of collective values by capitalist activity*

*c) the consolidation and accumulation of capital*

Despite their separation, they are all deeply interconnected and are manifestations of the changing face of society. However, they are useful distillations of the themes and theories analysed in this chapter. Marx's conceptions of commodities, objectification, and alienation have been rendered obsolete, inasmuch that the nature of production and consumption has changed. However, his writing is absolutely foundational to the later works which better theorise current social life.

 ourselves, each other, and the technologies which surround us.

## Americanism, Taylorism, & Fordism

Despite being held as a political prisoner by the Italian Fascist party, Antonio Gramsci was able to analyse and elaborate the enormous changes occurring on the American side of the Atlantic. While Marx had outlined the specific modes of varieties of alienation and exploitation, Gramsci provided a thorough and articulate account of American industry's effects on the worker at the time. After World War I, it was clear the changes taking place in the United States were bleeding over into European culture—the results of which prompted Gramsci's reflections on this potential new epoch of industrial life.

The aristocratic classes—kindly termed "parasites" by Gramsci and his contemporaries—were in a precarious position. The industrial revolution had been kind to the United States, and Europe wished to "have a full barrel and a drunken wife" inasmuch that it wished to match American productive capacity while maintaining its traditional aristocracy and attendant social classes (1971:564). While arguments of the time defended the existing class and social structures, Gramsci made quick work of them; cities across Europe had become rife with marginally productive citizens as consequence of law, custom, or tradition. In contrast, the United States did not have "this leaden burden to support"; something enabled by Weber's Protestant work ethic prevalence across all sections of American society (1971:570). In effect, American industry developed in a relative vacuum; the class structures and social conventions of Europe largely failed to transplant themselves across the Atlantic, and any that survived were eroded quickly as the young United States established its own society. As a result, firms were largely free to evolve and experiment with new and highly productive relationships between firms and workers.

Rationalism was the new order of the day, and was seized upon by men like Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford. Practices like vertical integration (the stratification and alignment of means of production along one firm's holdings and interests) made leaps and bounds in productivity and efficiency. Unions and skilled labour were subverted by the attractive wages and benefits that were offered by those improvements. Gramsci realised that the factory had become the epicentre of a new hegemony, where "the whole life of the nation revolve[d] around production" (1971:571).

As factory activity became the centre of productive life after World War I, *present complaints of "work-life imbalance" are rendered pathetic.* Rather than simple attempts at "puritanism", Gramsci made it clear that firms' invasion of workers' private lives was the manifestation of something else entirely: "the biggest collective effort to date to create, with unprecedented speed, and with a consciousness of purpose unmatched in history, a new type of worker and of man" (1971:597). He continues:

> It is from this point of view that one should study the "puritanical" initiative of American industrialists like Ford. It is certain that they are not concerned with the "humanity" or the "spirituality of the worker, which are immediately smashed. This "humanity and spirituality" cannot be realised except in the world of production and work and in productive "creation". They exist most in the artisan, in the "demiurge", when the worker's personality was reflected whole in the object created and when the link between art and labour was still very strong. But it is precisely against this "humanism" that the new industrialism is fighting. "Puritanical" initiatives simply have the purpose of preserving, outside of work, a certain psycho-physical equilibrium which prevents the physiological collapse of the worker, exhausted by the new method of production… …It is in their interests to have a stable, skilled labour force, a permanently well-adjusted complex, because the human complex (the collective worker) of an enterprise is also a machine which cannot, without considerable loss, be taken to pieces too often and renewed with single new parts. (Gramsci 1971:599)

Thusly, state and society adjusted to eliminate that which might deteriorate the "worker complex" through prohibition: alcohol, sexual deviance, etc. (1971:600). The Ford Motor Company eventually overreached in its meddling in the lives of its employees, but Fordism itself had become fully formed in its ability and desire to intervene in social life to maximise productivity. While Marx had articulated the methods by which the worker was alienated, those methods were more or less inherent. Fordism, however, was something else altogether: the actions it took toward the worker were intentional and designed toward maximum productivity. Gramsci conceded that this was progressive and beneficial in some respects, but that the time had come for a new "fundamental question": not of hegemony over Europe, but of hegemony *within* the United States (1971:572).

# A Society Changed

Despite some reservations, Gramsci was certain that Americanism and Fordism would leave their mark on the world. While other thinkers concerned themselves with the "new beacon of civilisation [that] has been lit over there", Gramsci openly derided them and instead stated:

> The problem is not whether in America there exists a new civilisation, a new culture, even if only as a “beacon”, and whether it is invading or has invaded Europe. If the problem were to be posed in that way, the answer would be simple: no, it does not exist, and indeed all that they do in America is to remasticate the old European culture. The problem is rather this; whether America, through the implacable weight of its economic production (and therefore indirectly), will compel or is already compelling Europe to overturn its excessively antiquated economic and social basis." (1971:620-21).

Gramsci recognised it was not a question of cultural dominance—it was the transformation of social relationships to reflect productive capacity. Furthermore, he recognised it was too soon to know exactly how the hyper-productive American society would make itself known elsewhere—a question answered soon after World War II.

*The Affluent Society*, John Kenneth Galbraith's analysis of post-war American society, managed to pick up on Gramsci's concerns. Galbraith was dead-set against Marxian analysis, but he understood the prevailing mindset of the period: production was the end-all, be-all of a nation's well-being, and all other social forces were the end results of capitalist industry and production at unprecedented scales. Galbraith's analysis focusses on the inevitable problems of success and production (e.g. marginal profits and declining demand), but in reading the text it is clear how thoroughly Fordism had permeated the social mindset. Galbraith speaks of a "New Class" which was meant to escape the dull and demeaning work of industrial production toward careers that were fulfilling and meaningful. Work weeks were declining as a consequence of growing productivity and the emphasis was no longer placed on production and acquisition of necessary commodities, but on the "rewards and importance of leisure" (Galbraith 1998:243). It is here that another fundamental transition was taking place. While public and theoretical discourse was concerned with production almost exclusively, the actual engines of economic activity were reconfiguring themselves. While the United States had been amply able to supply the rest of the Western world's needs after the war, the recovering economies of Europe were resulting in over-production and rapid decreases in marginal productivity. Indeed, rather than satiating the fundamental needs of a society, "productive energies [were] used to make things of no great urgency—things for which demand must be synthesised at elaborate cost lest they not be wanted" (Galbraith 1998:217). In this historical moment, the value of the individual was transitioning from their productive capacity to their consumptive capacity. The consumer society was born.

# The Consumer Society

It was from *The Affluent Society* that Jean Baudrillard began his analysis of the present sources of alienation in society. In retrospect, *The Consumer Society* is odd in that it marks a fundamental shift in thought for Baudrillard: after his establishment of the object value system through his first three books, he would break wholly from Marxist analysis toward analysis of mass communication. The beginnings of this shift are almost palpable throughout *The Consumer Society*, but the text is still a vital work in establishing consumption as the freshly-anointed secondary engine of contemporary economic activity. In the introduction to the text, George Ritzer's rightly observes that Baudrillard never quite makes the leap of consumption supplanting production (Baudrillard 1998: KL 90). It is worth noting Galbraith's analysis of this fact, with the benefit of hindsight in the introduction to the fortieth anniversary edition of *The Affluent Society*:

> In the real world, as I tell, the productive process incorporates the means by which wants are created, and these are further sustained by fashion, social aspiration and simple imitation. What others do or have, one should do or have. The most important and intrinsically most evident source of consumer demand is the advertising and salesmanship of those providing the product. First you make the good, the you make the market. This is deeply in conflict with accepted economic thought. In that, nothing was so fundamental as the concept of consumer sovereignty—the according of final economic authority to those the economic system serves. (Galbraith 1998:ix)

Both in 1998 at the time of revision and the original writing, the notion of consumer sovereignty was indeed sacrosanct. That Baudrillard did not go so far as completely upsetting the relationship between production and consumption is forgivable in retrospect. Once the liberty of inverting that relationship by placing consumption in the foreground and production as sustaining process, then *The Consumer Society* functions at a much more powerful level.

Unfortunately, Baudrillard makes a litany of inconsistent or conflicting claims about the nature of consumption throughout the text.



# Accumulation, Concentration, & The Present

*Where Baudrillard speaks broadly and harshly, Aglietta defines and discusses at length with economics of precision. The problems of Neo-Fordism are explained at length, and he provides an account of the other forces responsible for our current state of oppression through technology: centralisation and competition for capital.*

Neo-Fordism: "An articulation between process of production and mode of consumption" (117)

Where Gramsci saw the potential for abuse, Aglietta knew it in detail. Through *A Theory of Capitalist Regulation*, Michel Aglietta performed a rigorous analysis of Fordism's

- Has precedent in Marx (*Capital*: Volume One: Chapter 32: The Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation) and Gramsci (his study of the women of wealthy ruling classes in "Rationalisation of Production and Work").

*The accumulation and centralisation of capital leaves firms larger and better able to dictate the terms of the society. The computer industry—once a cottage industry—would give way to these models as these tools were better recognised as means of extracting value from knowledge work.*

## Susan Crawford, Captive Audience

*Useful example of capital accumulation and concentration in the telecommunications industries, and how the corporation has become the most powerful social organisation in the history of Western civilisation. Neatly ties together Aglietta and Baudrillard's main themes and concepts.*

*Attempts to roll back concentration are consistently met with claims of "smothering innovation" or "killing jobs" (Crawford KL 204). Echoes Galbraith's analysis that the dominant frame of analysis is productivity, though the actual benefits are heightened consumption, a la Baudrillard.*

# The Greek God Model of Governance

When Peter Ludlow wrote *Our Future in Virtual Worlds*, he was concerned with the particulars of online, virtual communities; something of a far cry from our previous examples of telecommunications giants and smartphones. While his usage of "virtual" is problematic (a microchip is not virtual in any sense; it is real and performs complex math toward a specific end), he does establish a number of extremely effective metaphors for understanding our relationship with the large corporate entities which define most if not all of our everyday experiences with smartphones and other information technologies (Ludlow 2010: KL 35).

While the examples given by Ludlow seem preposterous—self-organised vigilante groups gone mad with power, in-game newspapers writing exposes and eventually being driven out of the game—Ludlow actually articulates one of the more serious problems evident in online communities: dysfunctional governance. At the beginning of the text, he draws clear and deliberate parallels between real-world governments and institutions and virtual Terms of Service and ad-hoc organisations:

> Given all of the things that are virtual or at least partially virtual, it is a short step to ask whether things like states can be virtual too. The answer is that of course they can. Not only can they be virtual, but they already are. You don’t want to confuse the United States government with buildings in Washington DC, or with military hardware, or with the politicians and leaders of the government. These are all important agents in the conduct of governmental activities, but the government itself is a virtual entity that is layered on top of the buildings and hardware and politicians. (Ludlow 2010: KL 36-40)

While we take these institutions for granted in the real world, all that structure is lost in the transition to the virtual. Much like how Gramsci identified the lack of history, custom, or tradition in the United States which allowed it to undergo rapid social reorganisation, online communities lack the structures and institutions necessary for functional social life. As such, these communities are rife with social problems that have no established processes or practices associated with them. Instead, social dysfunction and social life must be directly mediated: a greek god steps in. Not Zeus, but the corporation responsible for the creation and maintenance of that community.

Ludlow uses the term "greek god" very intentionally. Rather than being impartial or well-intentioned, "They reach in and help a friend or take action against an enemy, but for the most part they let their world idly settle into a state of corruption and chaos. When they do take action, they attempt to rewrite the software running the world to solve the problem. But of course most social problems cannot be engineered away" (Ludlow 2010: KL 64-66). While there are Terms of Service and End User License Agreements designed to mediate conflicts, they only apply in the real world; the online community is essentially lawless.

But how does this possibly relate to our current relationships to smartphones and information technologies? Don't we have laws of nature and government which restrict what corporations can and cannot do? Yes, of course, but that does not take this into account: that for the foreseeable future, more and more of our social lives will take place through computers and virtual spaces created by corporations. While redress through real-world institutions can eventually remedy social concerns or injustices, the virtual spaces we inhabit are becoming increasingly distant or abstract from the real world. For example: prior to September 19th, 2012, the default Maps application on Apple Inc. iOS devices was powered by Google Maps. However, due an inability to reach a business agreement between Apple and Google, Apple switched to its own maps system, and all hell broke loose. Apple's service was simply not comparable to Google's, and as a consequence of two companies ending a business agreement, untold thousands of users the world over suffered in ways both large and small.

To return to Ludlow's metaphor, two gods began fighting, and the mere mortals beneath them suffered terribly. While the real-world results in this case may have more or less negligible, this case does illustrate the potential hazards of commoditised and corporate-governed online life. If Apple or Google does not approve of the content of your application, they are free to remove it from their app store. Verizon Wireless can change the conditions of your service at nearly any given moment. Comcast is free to mete out access to competing content services while providing free and easy access to its own. The examples are many and myriad, but the relevant sociological point is this: as social life moves from the real world, governed by public law and common institutions, we are faced with an uneven and irregularly enforced social life. And, speaking to Crawford's earlier arguments, a dystopian future governed by a handful of highly-efficient corporations designed to generate and serve consumers' "needs" suddenly becomes remarkably plausible.

# Conclusions

It does not serve serious academic work to employ scare tactics; it is unlikely that the terrible futures predicted by science fiction writers will become reality any time soon. However, it is clear that the modern corporation is capable of interfering in the lives of its customers/consumers/users more than was ever possible before. With respect to the Marxist analyses conducted earlier in this chapter, it should be immediately apparent that these issues are deserving of immediate and rigorous critique and analysis. While fighting alienation in real world terms is more important than ever, it is essential to keep our eyes forward. The smartphone is a landmark innovation, on the order of the original desktop computers, but is more affordable, accessible, and powerful than any other information technology that has preceded it. Let it be a tool for empowerment, rather than the next realm of objectification, commodification, consumption, and alienation.
