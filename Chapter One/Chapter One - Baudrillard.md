## Baudrillard

### The Consumer Society

*By the mechanisms so thoroughly outlined by Aglietta, Baudrillard breaks new ground by analysing society not through its production but its consumption. The worker's role as worker has been supplanted by his role as consumer. While not nearly so overt as Fordism's early attempts at intervention into the worker's life, the corporation's place in the consumer's life is no small one.*
