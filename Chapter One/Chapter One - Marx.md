## Marx

When considering smartphones—particularly the iPhone—many leap to Marx, exclaiming, "what an example of commodity fetishism!". While this layperson is correct in that these products are highly fetishised commodities, his response is reductive. Smartphones and other computers may be complicit in the alienation of the worker, but they are embedded in the larger social, political, and economic system that takes true responsibility. In that sense, Marx's writing was critical in establishing the critical discourse this paper intends to examine.

However, Marx's work was also limited. His typology of modes of alienation holds true even today, even though he failed to predict the specific, practical manifestations and consequences of these relationships (something Gramsci would accomplish soon thereafter). Similarly, his definition of the commodity and its use-value was limited and failed to anticipate the rise of media and other, non-material commodities. The smartphone itself is a tangible commodity, certainly, but its character and dimensions are virtually infinite as software can broaden or tighten its use-value at will.

### ***Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts:*** Alienated Labour

*Alienated labour is essential to understanding the plight of the worker/consumer in contemporary, productive society.*

In writing his manuscript on alienated labour, Marx had several key assumptions—that society operated on capitalist fundamentals; that the proletariat and the bourgeoisie were estranged—which allowed him to categorise the ways in which the worker was drawn away from a more natural state of labour. Alienation of the worker took four forms: alienation from the products of labour, alienation from labour itself, alienation from himself species-being, and alienation of the worker from other workers. (1994:59–61). It is against this backdrop that all later thinkers examined in this chapter make their arguments.

### ***Capital,*** Volume One: Chapter One: The Commodity Sections 1, 2, and 4

*The commodity is a powerful tool for understanding use-value and exchange value, but the transition to digital media (where any given commodity is virtually infinitely reproducible) rather breaks his analysis.*



- "The commodity is, first of all, an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind." 220
- - how is this changed when these commodities become *literally* internal?
- "The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach, or the imagination, makes no difference. Nor does it matter here how the things satisfies man's need, whether directly as a means of subsistence, i.e. an object of consumption, or indirectly as a means of production." 220
- - cf. Baudrillard's conception of consumption
- use-value is directly tied to "the physical properties of the commodity, and has no existence apart from the latter" 220
- "When examining use-values, we always assume we are dealing with definite quantities… …Use-values are only realised in use of in consumption." 221
- - first dilemma: how do we establish the use-value of devices which deliver media? do we consider the object in vacuum, or as the sum-whole of the entire ecosystem it has access to? (e.g. the TV and channels, the smartphone and apps) cf. Kevin Kelly's conception of the technium (which then renders useless Marx's definition of use-value, as it transcends the physical (German *technik*) to include the social and cultural (French *technique*))
- Marx identifies exchange-value as something wholly separate and abstract from use-value (eventually leading to the abstraction of human labour) 221–223
- Marx emphasises the importance of labour-time in establishing value
- - does that necessarily match with the social construction of value with smartphones? Are they not considered anonymous and magical? Hopefully answered in Section 4.
- "Commodities which contain equal quantities of labour, or which can be produced in the same time, have therefore the same value." 224
- - Android and iOS devices are extremely similar, but occupy vastly different segments of the market. cf. Baudrillard to examine consumption as the explanation.
- - Considering objects in a vacuum does not adequately explain the differences that exist in the smartphone marketplace. Any number of other factors influence the creation of value; namely, the ecosystems they inhabit and the consumptive value attributed to them (ref. Baudrillard).

[Marx's notion of the commodity is flawed, but alienation, production, and consumption are all central to later theories which establish the "walled gardens" which are established in computing.]
