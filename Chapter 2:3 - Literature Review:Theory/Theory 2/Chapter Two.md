# Introduction

In the grand drama of 24-hour mass media, technology is cast alternately as both hero and villain. In product announcements and unveilings, a new smartphone is heralded as "life companion" (Samsung 2013), while texting teens are diagnosed in grave tones with smartphone addiction. For an ever-growing portion of the population, there will have been no life before computers. While a conventional Marxist critique sees technology as no more than a means to the ends of various economic forces, it would seem that we somehow know the smartphones, tablets, laptops, and all other varieties of computers play a much more substantial role than that. 

Genevieve Bell, chief anthropologist for Intel (one of , if not the, world's preeminent microprocessor manufacturers), summarized moral crises about technology as such: technological innovations are well and good until they satisfy the following rules: 

1. Our relationship to time must change.
1. Our relationship to space must change. 
1. Our relationship to each other must change. (Thompson 2012)

While most, if not all, technological innovations could be argued to satisfy most, if not all, these rules, it is an interesting argument in that it does not presuppose technology as a static object or presence. Instead, technology becomes a fully-formed social actor in and of itself—albeit one without intention or agency. The purpose of this chapter is to broaden our discussion of the role of smartphones and other computers to that of all technology: how do the objects and constructs around influence us nd our relations to one another? And how might we take those lessons and reapply them to the smartphone?

The analysis provided by Marx and his theoretical descendants was essential to understanding our relations to one another with a critical eye. However, as our tools become more complex, more dynamic, and more present, we must consider how they factor into the social calculus of such a framework—and additional frameworks to understand a more complex and dynamic social life than has been conceived before. 

# A Brief Discussion of Technology Studies

## Mumford, Technics and Civilisation

"But the fact is that in Western Europe the machine had been developing steadily for at least seven centuries before the dramatic changes that accompanied the "industrial revolution" took place. Men had become mechanical before they perfected complicated machines to express their new bent and interest; and the will-to-order had appeared once more in the monastery and the army and the counting house before it finally manifested itself in the factory. Behind all the great material inventions of the last century and a half was not merely. A long internal development of technics: there was also a change of mind. Before the new industrial processes could take hold on a great scale, a reorientation of wishes, habits, ideas, goals was necessary." (1934:3)

"For note this: mechanisation and regimentation are not new phenomena in history: what is new is the fact that these functions have been protected and embodied in organised forms which dominate every aspect of our existence." (1934:4)

"No matter how completely technics relies upon the objective procedures of the sciences, it does not form an independent system, like the universe: it exists as an element in human culture and it promises well or ill as the social groups that exploit it well or ill." (1934:6)

"The machine itself, however, is a product of human ingenuity and effort: hence to understand the machine is not merely a first step toward re-orienting our civilisation: it is also a means toward toward understanding society and toward knowing ourselves." (1934:6)

"Can one distinguish and define the specific properties of a technics directed toward the service of life: properties that can distinguish it morally, socially, politically, esthetically from the cruder forms that preceded it?" (1934:7)

"In back of the development of tools and machines lies the attempt to modify the environment in such a way as to fortify and sustain the human organism: the effort is ether to extend the powers of the otherwise unarmed organism, or to manufacture outside the body a set of conditions more favourable toward maintaining its equilibrium and ensuring its survival." (1934:10)

"From the beginning the machine was a sort of minor organism, designed to perform a single set of functions." (1934:11)

"When I use the word machines hereafter I shall refer to specific objects like the printing press or the power loom. When I use the term "the machine" I shall employ it as a shorthand reference to the entire technological complex" (1934:12)

Mumford discusses the clock, cf. Bell (1934:12–18)

Mumford discusses space and distance, cf. Bell (1934:18–22)

Mumford discusses capitalism, cf. Ch. 1 (1934:23–28)

Mumford discusses animism, compare to marginal objects? Magic and the condescending UI? (1934:31–36)

Confluence of the machine and civilisation as the focus turned toward the measurable in the 18th and 19th centuries; natural philosophy has had an outsized influence on the development of the machine (1934:46)

"Unfortunately, isolation and abstraction, while important to orderly research and refined symbolic representation, are like wise conditions under which real organisms die, or at least cease to fiction effectively." (1934:50)

"If science presented an ultimate reality, then the machine was, like the law in Gilbert's ballad, the true embodiment of everything that was excellent. Indeed in this empty, denuded world, the invention of machines became a duty. By renouncing a large part of his humanity, a man could achieve godhood: he dawned on this second chaos and created the machine in his own image: the image of power, but power ripped loose from his flesh and isolated from his humanity." (1934:51)

"By the middle of the eighteenth century, the initial preparations were over and the key inventions had been made. An army of natural philosophers, rationalists, experimenters, mechanics, ingenious people, had assembled who were clear as to their goal and confident as to their victory. Before more than a streak of grey had appeared at the horizon's rim, they proclaimed the dawn and announced how wonderful it was: how marvellous the new day would be. Actually, they were to announce a shift in the seasons, perhaps a long cyclical change in the climate itself." (1934:59)

Upon hearing the word "binary", our minds leap to the realm of the digital. Indeed, virtually every computer on the planet operates by manipulating bits—switches capable of moving between two states. On to off, off to on. Visit any electronics store to buy a television store today, and you will be faced with a dilemma: how do I hook it up? Analog (the fiddly plugs all colours of the rainbow), or digital (the singular and shining jack)? Most today choose digital, but my god, the possibilities: gold-plated? Electromagnetic wave-shielded? Ask any geek worth his salt what to buy, and his answer will be simple: "whatever is cheapest. It's digital. It makes it, or it doesn't." On to off, off to on. It's very simple, isn't it? Except it isn't. While the geek's advice is technically true, digital video is comprised of thousands upon millions of bits, susceptible to degradation all the same. The loss of a 1 here or a 0 there can be disastrous. Reducing the transmission of a video to one large binary—yes or no, on or off—is not unlike reducing reality itself to a simple two-way switch; a few electrons are lost here, some errant atoms there, whoops—there goes reality. We know this not to be true. While reduction and simplification are powerful and useful tools for understanding our world, they are just that: reductive and simple. In limiting ourselves to the binary, we preclude the infinite. 

Donna Haraway said much the same in *Simians, Cyborgs, and Women* (more or less).
